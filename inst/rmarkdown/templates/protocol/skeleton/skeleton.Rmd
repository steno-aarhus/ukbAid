*This is a template for writing your protocol in a format that is easily
transferable to the [Open Science Framework registry](https://osf.io/) for all
types of studies. Because this database is not for observational studies per se,
there are fields that are not relevant for you to fill in. These fields have not
been included in this template. Also, all fields where you have to check a list
of items or similar, have also been excluded from this template.*

*Please also refer to a relevant reporting checklist (e.g. STROBE) when
describing the study. Find checklists [here](https://www.equator-network.org/)*
