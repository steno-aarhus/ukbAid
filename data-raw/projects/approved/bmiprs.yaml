project_title: 'BMIhom: Exploring Childhood PRS'
project_description: The proposed project aims to investigate the impact of deviations
  from genetically-determined body mass index (BMI) homeostasis on premature mortality,
  by leveraging large-scale population studies.This project involves utilizing childhood
  Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) as a proxy for genetic homeostatic BMI. Given that secular
  changes in the environment promoting weight gain have likely influenced adult BMI
  PRS, the childhood PRS offers a more stable and unbiased estimate of an individualâ€™s
  genetic predisposition to obesity. This will allow us to assess the long-term health
  risks associated with deviations from genetically-determined BMI across the lifespan.
  The findings from this research could lead to the development of personalized health
  interventions, helping to identify those at higher risk of mortality due to weight-related
  factors.
