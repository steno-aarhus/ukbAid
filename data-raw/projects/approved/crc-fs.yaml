project_title: Replacing animal-based foods with plant-based foods and risk of colorectal
  cancer in UK Biobank participants
project_description: Reducing red and processed meat intake or adopting a plant-based
  diet may lower the risk of colorectal cancer. However, the effects of decreasing
  the consumption of one type of food while concomitantly increasing the intake of
  another on colorectal cancer risk are not well understood. Thus, this project aims
  to investigate the association of statistically modelled replacement of animal-based
  foods with a variety of plant-based foods and the risk of developing colorectal
  cancer.
