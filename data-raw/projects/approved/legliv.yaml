project_title: Legume consumption and risk of primary liver cancer
project_description: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may be considered the
  hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. NAFLD-related primary liver cancer
  is a growing concern, and preventive interventions are critical. We will statistically
  model replacement of red meat consumption with legumes in relation to incident primary
  liver cancer and assess whether the association is mediated through NAFLD.
