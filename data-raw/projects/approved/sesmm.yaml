project_title: Socioeconomic status multimorbidity-disease trajectories, risk factors and the consequences
project_description: With the growing number of people suffering from diabetes-multimorbidity,
  and its heterogeneity in presentation and outcome, there is an urgent need to gain
  a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that determine different courses of progression
  towards diabetes-multimorbidity. The overall aim of the project is to describe the
  disease transition processes that lead to diabetes-multimorbidity and to determine
  drivers of multimorbidity trajectories. We will apply advanced epidemiological methods
  to three large populations using a multi-dimensional and multi-stage approach. There are
  two specific aims for the project. 1) To map the heterogeneity in trajectories of
  diabetes-multimorbidity and to identify risk factors contributing to pronounced
  diabetes-multimorbidity. This will be achieved by using a machine learning approach
  for risk prediction, which involves combining a genetic algorithm with a random
  forest classifier to enhance the results. 2) To understand mortality risk at different
  stages of the diabetes-multimorbidity trajectory, by comparing mortality as people
  transition from a healthy condition to single disease, and diabetes-multimorbidity
  using multi-state models.
