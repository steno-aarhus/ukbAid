project_title: 'Calculating Homeostatic BMI Index'
project_description: The aim of this project aims to link deviations from homeostatic BMI
  with fat mass, lean mass, and mortality risk. Further, it intends to examine the
  connection between genetically predicted BMI and observed BMI and how it relates
  to mortality risk. We will assess deviations from homeostatic BMI using a combination
  of phenotypic and genetic data to explore their potential impact on health indicators.
  Genetic risk scores for adult and childhood BMI will help us understand the implications
  of genetically predicted BMI versus observed BMI on mortality risk.
