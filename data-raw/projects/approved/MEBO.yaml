project_title: Investigating the Mediating Role of Biomarkers in the Relationship
  Between Socioeconomic Status and Multimorbidity
project_description: Socioeconomic status (SES) is a key upstream determinant of multimorbidity.
  Accumulating evidence, including findings from our recent study, has demonstrated
  an inverse association between SES and the risk of developing multiple chronic conditions.
  However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. There have been increasing
  calls to explore pathways that can help reduce social inequalities in morbidity
  and mortality. SES influences various health-related behaviors; for example, individuals
  from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to engage in unhealthy lifestyle
  choices, such as smoking, poor diet, and physical inactivity. These behaviors are
  further linked to detrimental metabolic changes through various biological pathways.
  Lifestyle factors and biomarkers may thus mediate the causal relationship between
  SES and multimorbidity. A systematic review has reported that lifestyle factors
  account for approximately 20%-30% of the socioeconomic disparity in health outcomes.However,
  few studies have quantified the proportion of the association between SES and multimorbidity
  mediated by metabolic biomarkers, particularly in distinguishing biomarkers from
  different metabolic pathways. Understanding the extent to which these biomarkers
  mediate the total effect is crucial for elucidating treatment mechanisms and evaluating
  their potential as intervention targets. Traditional mediation analyses are limited
  in their ability to handle high-dimensional mediators, and intermediate confounding
  presents a further challenge by complicating the estimation of path-specific effects.
  In this study, we aim to provide a comprehensive investigation of the mediating
  role of lifestyle factors (i.e., smoking, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, alcohol
  consumption, and sleep deprivation) and biomarkers (including blood lipids, HbA1c,
  glucose, IGF, CRP, Cystatin C, blood pressure, and other plasma metabolites). Specifically,
  we will quantify the extent to which the association between SES and multimorbidity
  is mediated through different pathways. The findings will contribute to understanding
  the metabolic mechanisms underlying the link between SES disadvantage, unhealthy
  lifestyle, and multimorbidity risk, providing evidence for potential disease prevention
  strategies. Causal machine learning methods, which can handle high-dimensional mediators
  and intermediate confounders will be applied.
