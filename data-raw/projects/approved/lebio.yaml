project_title: Legume consumption and hepatobiliary biomarkers
project_description: Increased consumption of legumes and pulses are recommended globally
  to mitigate non-communicable disease risk and negative environmental impacts of
  human diets. Research has found that high consumption of legumes may alter the risk
  of liver and gallbladder disease (hepatobiliary diseases), the underlying pathways
  are however understudied in humans. This project aims to investigate the association
  between consuming legumes and changes in hepatobiliary biomarker levels over time.
