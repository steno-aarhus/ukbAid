project_title: Legume consumption and risk of gallbladder disease
project_description: 'Higher legume consumption is recommended as a meat substitute
  to increase healthiness and minimize the climate impact from humans diets. Legumes
  has in animal studies and a few human studies shown to increase gallstone formation
  through altering the lipid metabolism in the liver. A high consumption of legumes
  may thus be associated with an increased risk of gallstones, yet there exists very
  few studies investigating this in human populations, particularly due to low consumption
  of legumes in many countries. Aim: To investigate the association between substituting
  meat, poultry, and fish for legumes and the risk of developing gallstone diseases
  in a cohort with moderate to high legume consumption.'
