project_title: UK Diabetes Classifier
project_description: We aim to develop an open-source algorithm/R package to classify
  prevalent and incident diabetes cases, including type in UK-based electronic health
  record (EHR) data, with primary emphasis on the UK Biobank. The classification will
  utilize data from both primary and secondary health care, including medication and
  procedure codes. We will include clinically relevant validation steps to improve
  specificity and sensitivity, particularly for distinguishing diabetes subtypes.
  The classification will not include self-reported data and biomarkers.
