project_title: The association between intake of anthocyanins and dietary fiber and
  the risk of cardiovascular and microangiopathy risk factors among people with and
  without T2D
project_description: 'Aim: To estimate the association between intake of anthocyanins
  and dietary fiber and the risk of cardiovascular and microangiopathy risk factors
  among people with and without T2D in the UK Biobank cohortExposure: The intake of
  anthocyanins and other flavonoid subclasses is calculated by assigning values to
  each food item from the Oxford WebQ 24-hour dietary assessments (as previously done
  by Bell et al. 2024). Similarly, the content of a recipe is determined by summing
  the flavonoid content of each individual food item.Dietary fiber intake will be
  calculated using the Englyst method. Outcomes: Hard endpoints (death, cardiovascular
  events, microangiopathic events, renal-related events, platelet-related thrombotic
  events).Study population and data: The study population includes healthy participants
  completing >2 Oxford WebQ 24-hour dietary assessments and participants with diagnosed
  T2D.Statistical analysis: The risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality will
  be investigated using a Cox Proportional Hazards Model with age as the underlying
  timescale in all participants, excluding those with the outcome of interest. In
  another analysis, only patients with T2D will be included at baseline. Quintiles
  of intake of anthocyanins and dietary fiber will be compared separately and combined
  in categorical and continuous analyses. In addition, potential interactions will
  be assessed using an interaction term between intake of anthocyanins and dietary
  fiber on the relative scale and quantifying the relative excess of interaction for
  investigation of the interaction in the additive scale. Potential confounders for
  both analyses will be selected using directed acyclic graphs.'
