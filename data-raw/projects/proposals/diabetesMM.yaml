project_title: 'The Role of Type 2 Diabetes in Shaping Multimorbidity Progression:
  Evidence from the UK Biobank Cohort'
project_description: People with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) face significantly
  higher risk of developing multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs) compared to the
  general population. The progression of T2D-related MLTCs is a dynamic process as
  T2D may occur at any stage in the sequence of MLTC development. However, most existing
  studies treat T2D as a static exposure and only adjust for the number of comorbidities
  at baseline. Multistate modeling approaches offer a framework to address these complexities
  by simultaneously accounting for multiple time dimensions and transitions between
  different morbid states, thus capturing the dynamic nature of MLTC progression.
  Our study aims to investigate the dynamic influence of T2D the rates of MLTC progression
  over time vary according to current LTC numbers.
