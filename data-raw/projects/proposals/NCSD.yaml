project_title: Effect of non-caloric soft drink on mental health, dementia, and stroke
  in patients with and without diabetes
project_description: This overall aim is to investigate the long-term effects of non-caloric
  soft drink (NCSD) consumption on the risk of mental illness, dementia, and stroke
  in individuals with and without type 2 diabetes. The intake of artificial sweeteners,
  particularly from non-caloric soft drinks (NCSD) has exploded in recent years and
  current dietary guidelines recommend people with diabetes to substitute sugary beverages
  with NCSD. The project will examine both direct associations and perform substitution
  analyses to evaluate the effect of replacing sugary beverages with NCSDs. For discovered
  associations, we will use causal mediation analysis to investigate which metabolites
  might explain the relationship between NCSD and mental health, dementia and stroke.
