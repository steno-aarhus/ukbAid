project_title: 'Investigating the Impact of Family-Based BMI Divergence on Premature
  Mortality: Development and Application of a Pedigree-Based Homeostatic Index'
project_description: The proposed project seeks to explore how deviations from an
  individual’s genetically-determined BMI, as calculated through familial relationships,
  influence the risk of premature mortality. By constructing a family-based BMI Homeostatic
  Index (BHI), we aim to capture the genetically-determined BMI for each individual
  using data from multiple generations within families. This index will serve as a
  measure of how much an individual’s BMI deviates from what would be expected based
  on their genetic background.The project involves calculating the BHI by analyzing
  BMI data across family members, taking into account the degree of relatedness between
  individuals. By using a pedigree-based approach, the BHI will quantify the divergence
  of an individual's BMI from their family's average, adjusted for factors such as
  age and sex. This approach allows us to assess whether these deviations are associated
  with increased mortality risk, offering insights into the genetic basis of obesity
  and its health consequences.
