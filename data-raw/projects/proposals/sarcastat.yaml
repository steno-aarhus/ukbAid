project_title: UK Biobank study on statins and muscle strength and volume
project_description: UK Biobank study on statins and muscle strength and volume. Sarcopenia
  is a progressive muscle disorder linked to aging, with a prevalence over 50% in
  individuals above 80. It can be primary (age-related) or secondary to factors like
  disease or medication use, including statins. Statins, widely used for cardiovascular
  prevention, have pleiotropic effects but may also cause muscle-related side effects,
  including myalgia and, rarely, rhabdomyolysis. While concerns exist about their
  role in sarcopenia, blinded trials have not confirmed an increased risk. Retrospective
  studies suggest statins may help maintain muscle mass in certain patients, but prospective
  data in healthy individuals remain inconclusive. Some studies report benefits with
  resistance training, while others show no impact on muscle strength or exercise
  capacity. We will use UK Biobank data to investigate long-term effects of statin
  therapy on handgrip strength and thigh muscle volume. We will compare statin users
  with matched non-statin users with the working hypothesis that statins prevent sarcopenia.
