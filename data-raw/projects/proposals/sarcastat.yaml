project_title: UK Biobank study on statins and muscle strength and volume
project_description: Statins, widely used as lipid-lowering therapy for
  cardiovascular prevention, have demonstrated significant benefits in reducing
  CVD events and all-cause mortality. However, their impact on muscle health
  remains debated. While statins might have muscle-related side effects such as
  myalgia and, rarely, rhabdomyolysis, concerns have also emerged about their role
  in sarcopenia, a progressive muscle disorder associated with aging. This
  relationship is particularly important as sarcopenia represents not only a
  decline in physical function but also a metabolic liability. The loss of
  metabolically active muscle tissue can impair glucose homeostasis, reduce
  resting energy expenditure, and contribute to insulin resistance, creating a
  vicious cycle where declining muscle health further compromises metabolic
  function, leading to even less physical activity and accelerated muscle loss.
  Epidemiological evidence on statins and muscle performance (e.g., strength) is
  mixed. Some retrospective studies suggest that statins may help maintain muscle
  mass in certain patients, potentially offering protective effects in those with
  metabolic disorders. However, prospective data in healthy individuals remain
  inconclusive. Some studies report benefits when statin use is combined with
  resistance training, while others show no impact on muscle strength or exercise
  capacity. Understanding these interactions is essential, particularly in
  populations at risk for diabetes and related conditions, as optimizing both
  cardiovascular protection and muscle health could improve overall patient
  management. To fill this gap, we will use UK Biobank data to investigate the
  long-term effects of statin therapy on handgrip strength and thigh muscle
  volume. We will compare statin users with matched non-statin users with the
  working hypothesis that statins prevent sarcopenia.
