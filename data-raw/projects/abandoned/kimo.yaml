project_title: Unraveling the Relationship Between Kidney Function and Cardiovascular
  Risk
project_description: The study aims to examine the association between kidney function
  and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and mortality in the general population, and examine
  whether this potential association is causal by employing the Mendelian Randomization
  (MR) approach. Firstly, we will investigate the association between kidney function (eGFR-based
  on plasma creatinine CKD-EPI, and possibly also cystatin C) and risk of MI, heart
  failure, stroke and all-cause mortality in 500,000 individuals from the UK Biobank. Then
  we will assess the causal direction between kidney function and CVD risk using a
  bidirectional MR analysis.
