Upload study protocol on osf.io and add link to project on Trello\nin R using UKB aid R package We have decided that all projects should include a pre-registered protocol of the study. This is to encourage more open research and, because there are so many projects being conducted in the UKB, to ensure that you can later claim to have been first with the research idea, if necessary. This is also good research practice and forces one to carefully think about the study before conducting analyses.\nIn addition to the protocol, we encourage that most will also include a detailed statistical analysis plan. This also makes it easier to perform the analysis, as there is a clear direction from the beginning. The analysis plan should be of a similar detail as how you would describe your analysis in a manuscript.\nNote that as an employee at the Region or Aarhus University you have access to get your analysis plan reviewed by a statistician as part of the CONNECT initiative. If you are doing new or more complicated analyses, we encourage you to use this offer.\nThe protocol can be written in R markdown using the template provided in the ukbAid R package. At this point, you will download the ukbAid R package on your own (local) computer."

There is something for everyone! In this way, we expect that anyone doing a project with us will also contribute to the community and other activities, including looking over others’ project code and text.\nAuthorship: We follow the principle of “if you’ve contributed on a fairly regular basis to this community, you deserve authorship on any outputs from this project”. Authorship is a strange, archaic concept that doesn’t easily fit into the modern research environment. So we instead view it as “contributorship” and leave the decision of being a “formal author” on any output to the contributors. These decisions will happen at the end of a projects lifecycle before uploading to an archive (like a preprint archive).\nProject activities: Activities like writing the paper, or coding for the analysis, or any thing else related to the project, must be done through Git and GitHub on the our steno-aarhus organization. You can have a “fork”/copy of the repository on your personal GitHub, but do your main work through the Steno account. We expect this because, in order to help troubleshoot and deal with any technical issues, it is significantly easier for us if it is on the Steno account."

So try to explain why changes are being made. Try to split changes into factual and aesthetic/robust changes. For instance, if some code does not do the action the coder expects, that is a factual change (a.k.a. a bug) and needs to be fixed immediately. Changes can also be a refactor that makes the code more robust, but doesn’t change the expected informational output (but might change the object type of the output, for instance from list to data frame).\nKeep pull requests very small and focused, so that the reviewee (and others) can understand and learn from what is being done. It also has the advantage that the PR can be referenced in other contexts to highlight issues that are recurring.\nAlways, be kind. Write commit messages and pull requests in a “teaching” form, with the emphasis on gentle learning.\n\n\n\nReviewee\n\nTry as much as possible to write code assuming someone else will read it. So write it in a way that makes it easier for someone to understand the flow and where things start and go next.\n\nFor instance, try to write code using {targets} package to write a pipeline to make it easy for a reviewer to follow along the logical and sequence of code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReviewer\n\nLearning happens from being in a space that feels safe and feels supportive. So during the code review session, make sure to reinforce this concept. Be aware of the language you use when explaining things. It isn’t about putting people down, but bringing them up and empowering them with knowledge and learning.\nSelect some key PRs that were done before the session and walk through it, while explaining the rationale for the change.\nAfter going through the PR, select a project to review and do a “live code review” of sections of it. While going through it, verbally explain the thought process for what the reviewer is looking for, where they start, etc."

To examine the nature of the investigated associations, we will integrate results from different statistical methods, where each of the methods has different and largely unrelated sources of potential bias, i.e., triangulation. Besides common regression analyses, the methods will include, but not be restricted to dyadic multilevel modeling, instrumental variable approach, mediation analyses, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and image analyses. This will enable us to estimate the relative contribution of heritability (genetic variants as instruments for exposure) and environmental exposures (early life, adult lifestyle, parental and spousal/household exposure) on the risk of developing diabetes and associated diseases/conditions. This could potentially help identify preventable risk factors and potential drug-targets in diabetes and associated diseases."

The background and scientific rationale of the proposed research project in general\nDiabetes is a major public health burden with an estimated global prevalence of 463 million people. An estimated half of all people with diabetes are unaware of their disease and consequently will delay the onset of treatment and increase the risk of developing complications and comorbidities. These complications and comorbidities include certain types of cancers and mental health disorders (Parkinson’s disease, dementia, mood disorders), cardiovascular disease (CVD), gastro-intestinal disorders, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. These complications also often share the same risk factors as diabetes, such as obesity, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, making it difficult to disentangle the relative contribution that diabetes might have on the risk for complications. For instance, people with diabetes have a higher prevalence of thyroid disorders compared with the normal population (10.8% vs. 6.6%). Diabetes and thyroid disorders have been shown to mutually influence each other: thyroid hormones contribute to the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism and pancreatic function, and diabetes affects thyroid function tests to variable extents. The presence of thyroid dysfunction may affect diabetes control, such as for the relationship between hyperthyroidism and worsening glycemic control and increased insulin requirements."

    "text": "A4. A brief description of the method(s) to be used\nIn addition to simple regression analyses in observational studies, we will employ several other statistical methods. While observational studies are prone to confounding and reverse causation, the genetic methods are largely free from both, and thus allow for inference on causality. For the genetic analysis we will use one-sample (e.g., Wald ratio) as well as two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) methods (inverse variance weighted, weighted median, MR-Egger, MR-PRESSO, MR Steiger), as the latter method performs well even within a single large sample such as the UK Biobank. Since the different two-sample MR methods make different assumptions about horizontal pleiotropy (when a genetic variant affects the outcome of interest through traits or pathways other than or in addition to the intermediate phenotype under investigation), we will apply them all in order to lower risk of false positive findings and bias.\nTo examine the pathways through which an exposure affects an outcome, we will employ mediation analyses: multivariable MR (MVMR) and the NetCoupler-algorithm. MVMR allows for equivalent analysis to mediation within the MR framework, and can therefore estimate mediation effects. NetCoupler is an algorithm that estimates causal pathways between a set of -omic (e.g., metabolomics, lipidomics) or other high-dimensional metabolic data and either a disease outcome, an exposure, or both.\nDyadic multilevel analysis will be used to identify hour-by-hour patterns of covariation in daily physical activity and sleep between couples over a seven day time window. Image analyses based on different established as well as novel modalities will be used to investigate the associations between metabolic phenotypes and diabetes with cardiovascular and cerebral/cognitive complications, i.e. target organ damage (e.g., cardiac function, vascular integrity, carotid remodeling, structural cerebral change) and clinical complications (cardiovascular event, cognitive function)."

People with diabetes are at a higher risk for getting other health complications like cardiovascular disease, kidney and thyroid diseases, cancer, and mental health disorders. These complications also often share the same risk factors as diabetes, such as obesity, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. We want to understand how diabetes contributes to these complications/conditions (and vice versa) so that we can use that information in trying to find potential treatments with drugs or other interventions. For instance, if diabetes impacts a certain disease because of genes, this might be a good place to consider how drugs might help. Or if we find that a specific lifestyle behaviour or feature in the environment, an intervention might be a better approach to use. The project is going to last at least three years."

Accumulating evidence, including findings from our recent study, has demonstrated an inverse association between SES and the risk of developing multiple chronic conditions. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. There have been increasing calls to explore pathways that can help reduce social inequalities in morbidity and mortality. SES influences various health-related behaviors; for example, individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to engage in unhealthy lifestyle choices, such as smoking, poor diet, and physical inactivity. These behaviors are further linked to detrimental metabolic changes through various biological pathways. Lifestyle factors and biomarkers may thus mediate the causal relationship between SES and multimorbidity. A systematic review has reported that lifestyle factors account for approximately 20%-30% of the socioeconomic disparity in health outcomes.However, few studies have quantified the proportion of the association between SES and multimorbidity mediated by metabolic biomarkers, particularly in distinguishing biomarkers from different metabolic pathways. Understanding the extent to which these biomarkers mediate the total effect is crucial for elucidating treatment mechanisms and evaluating their potential as intervention targets. Traditional mediation analyses are limited in their ability to handle high-dimensional mediators, and intermediate confounding presents a further challenge by complicating the estimation of path-specific effects. In this study, we aim to provide a comprehensive investigation of the mediating role of lifestyle factors (i.e., smoking, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, alcohol consumption, and sleep deprivation) and biomarkers (including blood lipids, HbA1c, glucose, IGF, CRP, Cystatin C, blood pressure, and other plasma metabolites). Specifically, we will quantify the extent to which the association between SES and multimorbidity is mediated through different pathways. The findings will contribute to understanding the metabolic mechanisms underlying the link between SES disadvantage, unhealthy lifestyle, and multimorbidity risk, providing evidence for potential disease prevention strategies. Causal machine learning methods, which can handle high-dimensional mediators and intermediate confounders will be applied.\n\nLead author: Jie Zhang, Postdoc researcher at Region Midt (through Steno or AUH)\nGitHub repository: github.com/steno-aarhus/MEBO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbhi: Investigating the Impact of Family-Based BMI Divergence on Premature Mortality: Development and Application of a Pedigree-Based Homeostatic Index\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed project seeks to explore how deviations from an individual’s genetically-determined BMI, as calculated through familial relationships, influence the risk of premature mortality. By constructing a family-based BMI Homeostatic Index (BHI), we aim to capture the genetically-determined BMI for each individual using data from multiple generations within families. This index will serve as a measure of how much an individual’s BMI deviates from what would be expected based on their genetic background.The project involves calculating the BHI by analyzing BMI data across family members, taking into account the degree of relatedness between individuals. By using a pedigree-based approach, the BHI will quantify the divergence of an individual’s BMI from their family’s average, adjusted for factors such as age and sex. This approach allows us to assess whether these deviations are associated with increased mortality risk, offering insights into the genetic basis of obesity and its health consequences.\n\nLead author: Nuno Nogueira, Postdoc researcher at Aarhus University\nGitHub repository: github.com/steno-aarhus/bhi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbmihom: Calculating Homeostatic BMI Index\n\n\n\n\n\nThe aim of this project aims to link deviations from homeostatic BMI with fat mass, lean mass, and mortality risk.

Given that secular changes in the environment promoting weight gain have likely influenced adult BMI PRS, the childhood PRS offers a more stable and unbiased estimate of an individual’s genetic predisposition to obesity. This will allow us to assess the long-term health risks associated with deviations from genetically-determined BMI across the lifespan.

The overall aim of the project is to describe the disease transition processes that lead to diabetes-multimorbidity and to determine drivers of multimorbidity trajectories. We will apply advanced epidemiological methods to three large populations using a multi-dimensional and multi-stage approach. There are two specific aims for the project. 1) To map the heterogeneity in trajectories of diabetes-multimorbidity and to identify risk factors contributing to pronounced diabetes-multimorbidity. This will be achieved by using a machine learning approach for risk prediction, which involves combining a genetic algorithm with a random forest classifier to enhance the results. 2) To understand mortality risk at different stages of the diabetes-multimorbidity trajectory, by comparing mortality as people transition from a healthy condition to single disease, and diabetes-multimorbidity using multi-state models. To develop a web application that helps clinicians visualize the potential impact of an intervention or achieving tighter therapeutic targets on the future risk of all components of diabetes-multimorbidity. This step will be conducted by integrating results from aims 1 and 2 using simulation approaches.\n\nLead author: Jie Zhang, Postdoc researcher at Aarhus University\nGitHub repository: github.com/steno-aarhus/dmm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlebio: Legume consumption and hepatobiliary biomarkers\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased consumption of legumes and pulses are recommended globally to mitigate non-communicable disease risk and negative environmental impacts of human diets.

However, their impact on muscle health remains debated. While statins might have muscle-related side effects such as myalgia and, rarely, rhabdomyolysis, concerns have also emerged about their role in sarcopenia, a progressive muscle disorder associated with aging. This relationship is particularly important as sarcopenia represents not only a decline in physical function but also a metabolic liability. The loss of metabolically active muscle tissue can impair glucose homeostasis, reduce resting energy expenditure, and contribute to insulin resistance, creating a vicious cycle where declining muscle health further compromises metabolic function, leading to even less physical activity and accelerated muscle loss. Epidemiological evidence on statins and muscle performance (e.g., strength) is mixed. Some retrospective studies suggest that statins may help maintain muscle mass in certain patients, potentially offering protective effects in those with metabolic disorders. However, prospective data in healthy individuals remain inconclusive. Some studies report benefits when statin use is combined with resistance training, while others show no impact on muscle strength or exercise capacity. Understanding these interactions is essential, particularly in populations at risk for diabetes and related conditions, as optimizing both cardiovascular protection and muscle health could improve overall patient management. To fill this gap, we will use UK Biobank data to investigate the long-term effects of statin therapy on handgrip strength and thigh muscle volume. We will compare statin users with matched non-statin users with the working hypothesis that statins prevent sarcopenia.\n\nLead author: Jie Zhang, Postdoc researcher at Region Midt (through Steno or AUH)\nGitHub repository: github.com/steno-aarhus/sarcastat"

The easiest way that we’ve found is to do your work through Git and GitHub on the SDCA GitHub Organization. We’ll explain the reasons in the Working on the RAP page. We expect everyone working on the Steno UK Biobank project to use Git and use Steno’s GitHub Organization account to store their project. We will set up the project for you on the Organization account, so you can start working on your project sooner."

    "text": "Steps to take before using the RAP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMost of these steps only need to be done once, except for one step that we will indicate below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSome of these tasks can be really difficult to understand what’s going on, and that’s ok and totally normal. The very start of a project is often one of the most difficult stages of a project. But if you follow these tasks, you’ll have a solid foundation for doing your work within the special environment of the UK Biobank RAP.\n\n\nThe very first tasks you’ll need to do is to install the ukbAid package. Open RStudio and in the Console run these code:\n\n# Install the pak package if you haven't already.\n# install.packages(\"pak\")\npak::pak(\"steno-aarhus/ukbAid\")\n\nAfter that, we need to make sure that your computer has Git configured properly. In your Console, type out the below code, replacing my name (Luke) and my email with your own:\n\nukbAid::proj_setup_git_config(\"Luke W. Johnston\", \"lwjohnst@gmail.com\")\n\nYou should get an output showing your user.email and user.name.\nSince we will be connecting to GitHub often through RStudio, we need a way to authenticate to GitHub that we are who we say we are. We do that in a relatively easy way by creating a thing called a Personal Access Token (PAT) in GitHub so that Git on your computer knows how to connect your project to GitHub. While in your RStudio project, in the Console type out this function:\n\nusethis::create_github_token()\n\nThis will send you to your GitHub account and create a basic PAT for you. Change the token’s description to something like “For UKB project”. Set the “Expiry date” to 90 days (this is a good security feature). Scroll down and click the create token button, which will change pages and you’ll be shown a string of letters starting with ghp_. Copy this token and save it somewhere safe, preferably in a password manager. This token acts a bit like your password but is safer to use than your password. Once you’ve saved it somewhere, go back to RStudio and than run this function in the Console:\n\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n\nPaste the token into the prompt in the Console. If it asks to replace an existing one, select the “yes” option. Doing this is a bit like using the 2FA message with the temporary passcode you get sent whenever you have to open your work’s email or when you use MitID or NemID (in Denmark).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe function above is the one you will need to run more than once (aside from the usethis::creat_github_token() every 90 days). Every time you open RStudio (or start your computer), you need to run this function and give R the PAT so that it can connect to GitHub securely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhy do we need to do this on our computer? Because whenever you connect to GitHub through RStudio (like uploading and downloading your changes), GitHub needs you to authenticate that it is you and not someone else. In order to do that, you need to give GitHub a password to do that. In the past, you could use your same password connected to your GitHub account, but the problem with this method is that your password gets sent over the Internet many times, which increases the risk that someone will maliciously obtain your password. So instead, we use a temporary, restricted-access token that we can easily create and delete. This token only has limited access to your account, so it is safer to send over the Internet, and it can be very easy to delete without affecting your account.\n\n\nNext, you will need to download (“clone” in Git language) the project repository that was created for you. In the Console, type out this, replacing my (Luke’s) project abbreviated name (mesh) with your project abbreviated name. You can find your GitHub project on SDCA’s account, if you don’t remember your project name.\n\nusethis::create_from_github(\"steno-aarhus/mesh\")\n\nFrom here, go to the Desktop or wherever you created the project and open up the RStudio .Rproj file so that the project starts up in RStudio. In this project will be the files you need to get started on the project, and especially at this stage, the doc/protocol.qmd and the data-raw/project-variables.csv files. You’ll be working on these files before beginning to use the RAP and doing analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMost likely, you are new to Git and GitHub. Git is a very powerful way of managing your files and your projects, but it also requires some major conceptual rewiring of how you work with files and computers. It takes some time to learn! Check out the section on Git in the Introduction to Reproducible Research in R course to learn more about using it.\nYou’ve just downloaded your GitHub project onto your computer. Unlike Dropbox or OneDrive, the files in your project on your computer don’t automatically synchronize with those on GitHub. You have to do it manually. Whenever you use Git and save your changes to the Git history, you need to “Push” (upload) your changes to your project files to GitHub. The diagram below shows how it conceptually looks like:\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR;\n    Local --&gt;|Push| GitHub\n    GitHub --&gt;|Pull| Local\n    UKB-RAP --&gt;|Push| GitHub\n    GitHub --&gt;|Pull| UKB-RAP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “Local” is your own computer. Whenever you “push” to GitHub, it means it will upload your file changes (like synchronizing in Dropbox). Whenever you “pull” from GitHub, it takes any changes made on GitHub and downloads them to your “Local” computer.\nWhen you work on the UKB-RAP, you will “pull” (download) your project from GitHub. As you work on it and save changes in your Git history, you “push” (upload) to GitHub often in order to keep your changes backed up. Then, when you get to the paper writing stage, you can pull your results from GitHub to your “Local” so you can work without getting charged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhy do we do it this way? For one, it is honestly the easiest that we could think of because the UKB RAP is a special environment that requires special steps to work in. Plus, using Git and GitHub makes it easier to have others (like me) collaborate on your project and help you out. So hypothetically, if you need help, I (Luke) could download your project from GitHub and make changes there. Conceptually it would look like:\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph TD;\n    UKB-RAP --&gt;|Push| GitHub\n    GitHub --&gt;|Pull| UKB-RAP\n    You --&gt;|Push| GitHub\n    GitHub --&gt;|Pull| You\n    Luke --&gt;|Push| GitHub\n    GitHub --&gt;|Pull| Luke\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat way it makes it super easy for me (or others) to help out.\n\n\nAs you work on your project, specifically the protocol and selecting the variables for your project from the data-raw/project-variables.csv list, you’ll use Git to save the changes made and push up to GitHub. Note that there are some variables in the list of variables we have that don’t exist in the RAP database, for instance like date of birth. This may be due to privacy concerns, so instead you would have to use year of birth (p34) to determine their age. Once your protocol has been reviewed and uploaded to Zenodo, you’re now ready to start doing the data analysis on the RAP.\nBut before doing anything else, complete the tasks in the TODO.md file, which will direct you to fill in details in the README.md. After you’ve done the TODO items, start working towards writing the protocol and analysis plan before beginning your work in the UKB RAP."
