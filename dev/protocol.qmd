## Legume consumption and risk of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in the UK Biobank Study: a prospective follow-up

## Description

Western diets has been shown to cause a multitude of non-communicable
diseases. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease
(MASLD) is the leading chronic disease globally and strongly associated
with Western dietary patterns. Based on a combined environmental and
health related focus, legumes are increasingly being recommended as a
meat substitute, and this study therefore investigates the association
between substituting legumes for meats, poultry, and fish and the risk
of developing MASLD.

## Objectives and hypotheses

### Background

The EAT-Lancet reference diet was introduced in 2019 as a globally
sustainable and healthy diet emphasizing plant-based proteins instead of
animal-based proteins, e.g., with a recommendation of 100 g legumes
daily (1-3). Legume consumption minimizes the risk of metabolic
dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in animals, by
reducing build-up of fats in the liver (10-14). MASLD is the most
prevalent chronic liver disease in the Western countries with a
prevalence of 15-45% (15, 16). The disease is caused by Western diets
high in red meat, fats, and sugars, obesity, physical inactivity, and
smoking (15-18). As legumes are a source of both carbohydrates and
proteins, research frequently compare legumes with other carbohydrate
sources (9, 34-37). Observed associations for foods may be due the
specific foods itself. However, the associations could also represent
the effect of the dietary pattern in which the specific food is
consumed. When individuals limit intake of certain food groups, they
will most often increase the intake of certain other food groups, in an
otherwise stable diet (38, 39). The association of such food intake will
not only be caused by the increased consumption of one food, but rather
the substitution effect including various foods. Replacing protein from
animal sources with protein from plant sources has previously been
associated with a substantially lower mortality rate and lower risk of
MASLD (40, 11). Consumption of legumes in the Western countries has been
negligible to date and the impact of markedly increasing intakes of
legumes on hepatobiliary and other diseases is understudied. Therefore,
this study aims to investigate the effect of replacing meats, poultry,
or fish with legumes and the risk of metabolic dysfunction-associated
steatohepatitis (MASH) or MASLD contingent on potential confounding
factors. As it might be more feasible for Western populations to include
legumes and substituting dietary components that are not meats, this
study will also aim to investigate the effect of a non-specific
substitution of dietary non-meat components for legumes on the risk of
MASLD and MASH.

**Hypothesis**

-   Replacing meats and poultry intakes with legumes is associated with
    a lower risk of MASLD and MASH.

-   Replacing fish intake with legumes is not associated with a lower
    risk of MASLD and MASH.

-   Replacing non-specific foods with legumes is not associated with a
    lower risk of MASLD and MASH.

# Design plan

## Study type

**Observational Study**. Data is collected from study subjects that are
not randomly assigned to a treatment. This includes surveys, natural
experiments, and regression discontinuity designs.

## Blinding

No blinding is involved in this study.

## Study design

**Study population and setting**

The initial recruitment of participants for the UK Biobank started in
2006 and ran until June 2010. Of 9.2 million people identified from the
National Health Service registers and invited to participate in the
study, 5.5% participated, approximately 500,000 participants, aged 37-73
years at baseline. The study protocol and more information are available
elsewhere (41, 42). All participants gave written, informed consent
prior to baseline, and the study was approved by the National
Information Governance Board for Health and Social Care and the National
Health Service North West Multicentre Research Ethics Committee
(reference number 06/MRE08/65).

# Sampling plan

## Existing data

**Registration prior to analysis of the data**

As of the date of submission, the data exist and you have accessed it,
though no analysis has been conducted related to the research plan
(including calculation of summary statistics). A common situation for
this scenario when a large dataset exists that is used for many
different studies over time, or when a data set is randomly split into a
sample for exploratory analyses, and the other section of data is
reserved for later confirmatory data analysis.

## Explanation of existing data

The UK Biobank is a large national cohort of participants in the UK,
with data collected in a standardized format the the sole purpose of
providing a data resource for researchers to use for health research.
All information about collection procedures, limitations, and sources of
bias are well established and described by the UK Biobank resource.

Because of its size of data collected, it is near impossible to a priori
see patterns in the data that might influence how the analysis will be
conducted, unless specifically looked for or previously published on. In
this way, we feel pre-analysis bias is minimal.

## Data collection procedures

**Study population and setting**

At baseline, participants provided detailed information on several
sociodemographic, physical, lifestyle, and health-related
characteristics via self-completed touch-screen questionnaires and a
computer assisted personal interview (43). Professionally trained staff
did physical, anthropometric, and biomedical measures following
standardized procedures (41). Diet was assessed through a touchscreen
questionnaire at baseline and a 24-hour dietary assessment tool designed
for the UK Biobank study. The 24-hour dietary assessment tool was
completed by participants up to five times and 210,965 individuals
completed one or more 24-hour dietary assessments (44).

**Assessment of diet**

The Oxford WebQ was designed as an internet based 24-hour dietary
assessment tool for measuring diet on repeated occasions. The
questionnaire is a short set of food frequency questions on commonly
eaten food groups in the British population on the day before. The
questionnaire aims to measure the type and quantity of food and
beverages consumed in the last 24 hours and estimate nutrients from the
entered information through the UK Nutrient Databank Food Composition
Tables (45, 46). The Oxford WebQ was compared with interviewer
administered 24-hour dietary recalls and validated for macronutrients
and total energy intake using recovery biomarkers and comparing with a
single food frequency questionnaire (45, 47, 48). Recently, the Oxford
WebQ nutrient calculation was updated to provide more detailed
information on nutrient intakes and to incorporate new dietary variables
(46). Participants recruited between April 2009 and September 2010
completed the Oxford WebQ at baseline (n=70,747). The Oxford WebQ was
not available until April 2009 and participants recruited before that
date who provided a valid email address were invited to complete the
four subsequent 24-hour dietary assessments online (49).

**Legumes**

Legume consumption will be estimated based on participants reported
diets from the self-administered online 24-hour dietary assessments, the
Oxford WebQ. Consumption of legumes and pulses will be based on total
weight by food group intakes estimated from participants' responses in
the Oxford WebQ. Despite the high detail level of the Oxford WebQ, a
single 24-hour dietary assessment cannot capture habitual intake of
legumes in a UK-setting (50). Therefore, this study will include varying
numbers of 24-hour dietary assessments to ensure that we capture usual
intake of legumes. Usual intake will be estimated as a daily average
across available 24-hour dietary assessments.

**Meat, poultry, and fish**

Consumption of red and processed meats, poultry, and fish will be based
on total weight by food group intakes estimated from participants'
responses to the Oxford WebQs. Red and processed meat will be defined as
beef, pork, lamb, and other meats including offal, and processed meat
including sausages, bacon, ham, and liver paté. Poultry will be defined
as poultry with or without skin, and fried poultry with batter or
breadcrumbs. Fish will be defined as oily fish, white fish and tinned
tuna, fried fish with batter or breadcrumbs, and shellfish.

**Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease**

Incident cases of MASH and MAFLD will be assessed through linkage to the
National Health Service registers where diagnosis after hospital
admission or primary care visits are coded according to the
International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems
(ICD-10) (51). MASLD was previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD), but the nomenclature was changed in 2023 to shift focus
towards the metabolic factors underlying the disease and not merely the
lack of alcohol consumption and to aid the prevention and early
diagnoses of MASLD (22). Due to this change in nomenclature, incident
cases of MASLD are diagnosed based on ICD-10-code for NAFLD, K76.0, at
first admission to hospital, while incident cases of MASH are diagnosed
based on ICD-10-code for NASH, K75.8 (52).

**Covariates**

Directed acyclic graphs were used to illustrate the potential and known
association between covariates of the association between substituting
meat, poultry or fish for legumes and development of MAFLD and MASH.
Information on covariates will include information on all other dietary
components based on total weight by food group intakes as g/day and
kcal/day retrieved from the Oxford WebQ (fruits, vegetables, cereal
products, dairy products, egg products, nuts, mixed dishes, condiments,
added sugar and sweets, non-alcoholic beverages, and alcoholic
beverages), sex (male, female), age (years), alcohol consumption (g
ethanol/day as restricted cubic splines), ethnic group (white, mixed
background, Asian, black, other, and unknown), socioeconomic status
(Townsend deprivation score \[quintiles\], educational level),
geographical region of recruitment (ten UK regions), lives with a wife
or partner (yes, no), anthropometry (BMI \[kg/m2\]), physical activity
(low \[0-9.9 METs/week\], moderate \[10-49.9 METs/week\], and high \[≥50
METs/week\], unknown), smoking status (never, former, current 1-15
cigarettes per day, current ≥15 cigarettes per day, current but number
of cigarettes per day unknown, and smoking status unknown); metabolic
risk factors (and self-reported \[yes, no, unknown\] diagnoses of
diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol).

## Sample size

For this cohort study, only participants with two or more 24 h dietary
assessments will be included in the analyses, while missing information
on covariates will be filled in by statistical imputations where
applicable. Individuals with alcohol intakes exceeding the 90th
percentile will be excluded from the study to mitigate the risk of
misclassifying the outcome by eliminating those with alcoholic fatty
liver disease.

## Sample size rationale

# Variables

## Measured variables

**Exposures:** g/day and kcal/day consumption of legumes, meats,
poultry, and fish

**Outcomes:** metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease
(MAFLD) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH)

**Covariates:** g/day and kcal/day consumption of fruits, vegetables,
cereal products, dairy products, egg products, nuts, mixed dishes,
condiments, added sugar and sweets, non-alcoholic beverages, and
alcoholic beverages. Sex, age, ethnic group, Townsend deprivation score,
educational level, geographical region of recruitment (ten UK regions),
lives with a wife or partner, BMI, physical activity, smoking status,
and self-reported diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol.

# Analysis plan

## Statistical models

### Main analyses

Standard summary statistics will be performed to describe the
distribution of total legume consumption as an average g/day based on
participants' 24-h WebQ responses and across baseline characteristics of
participants in the study. Multi-variable adjusted Cox Proportional
Hazards regression models will be used to estimate the hazard ratios for
each of the outcomes based on replacing meats, poultry, or fish with
legumes.

-   Replacing red and processed meats, poultry, or fish with legumes
    (e.g., per 30 g/day)

-   Replacing red and processed meats, poultry, or fish with legumes
    (e.g., per 40 kcal/day)

Age will be used as the underlying time scale in the analyses. Follow-up
time will begin with participants' last completed Oxford WebQ. As
participants in UKB are still followed-up today, participants will be
right censored at the date of the most recent registry update of full
follow-up for the outcomes. Otherwise, censoring will occur at the event
of death, loss to follow-up from the study, or date of diagnosis of
MASLD or MASH, whichever comes first. The substitution analyses will be
conducted with different adjustment levels.

**Model 1** will be minimally adjusted for strata of age at recruitment
(\<45, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, ≤65 years) and geographical region of
recruitment (ten UK regions), sex, and intake of all other dietary
components apart from the substitute components (red and processed
meats; poultry; fish). When substituting g legumes/day, the unit for all
dietary components will be g/day and the analyses will be adjusted for
total amount of consumed foods in g/day. When substituting calories of
legumes, the unit for all dietary components will be calories/day and
the analyses will be adjusted for total amount of consumed calories/day.

**Model 2** will be further adjusted for alcohol consumption, ethnic
group (white, mixed, Asian, black, other, unknown), socioeconomic status
(Townsend deprivation score, educational level), living with a wife or
partner (yes, no), physical activity (low \[0-9.9 METs/week\], moderate
\[10-49.9 METs/week\], and high \[≥50 METs/week\], unknown), smoking
status (never, former, current 1-15 cigarettes per day, current ≥15
cigarettes per day, current but number of cigarettes per day unknown,
and smoking status unknown), and self-reported diagnosis of diabetes,
hypertension, or high cholesterol (yes, no, unknown).

**Model 3** will further adjust for anthropometry (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2), as
obesity may either confound or mediate the association between replacing
red and processed meats, poultry, or fish with legumes and risk of MASLD

### Secondary and sensitivity analyses

To evaluate the association between overall legume intake and
hepatobiliary disease risk, quintiles of legume intake (g/day) will be
evaluated with adjustment levels similar to the substitution models.

Peas are increasingly used as a plant-based meat alternative in the food
industry (53). Despite this, peas are also included in the NHS 5 A Day
recommendations for fruits and vegetables consumption in the UK (54).
Therefore, in secondary analyses consumption of legumes will include
participants self-reported intake of legumes and pulses together with
consumed peas. The amount of peas consumed will be estimated based on
participants' reported daily portions consumed with a portion size of
peas weighing 80 g (55).

To evaluate the robustness of the main analyses, sensitivity analyses
will include varying numbers of Oxford WebQ returns, and removal of
participants with increased serum levels of alanine-aminotransferase
(\>45 U/L for women and \>70 U/L for men) and aspartate-aminotransferase
(\>35 U/L for women and \>45 U/L for men). Sensitivity analyses will
further include removal of participants in the highest 10% percentile of
alcohol intake and removal of those with previous diseases of the liver,
although not necessarily MAFLD, as they may be predisposed for
developing further liver diseases.

All analyses will be conducted in R with a significance level of 5%.

## Transformations

## Inference criteria

All analyses will be evaluated based on two-sided p-values. Values below
5% are classified as statistically significant. Inference on relevance
and significance and the evaluation of, whether a result is meaningful
will be based on the size of the estimate, confidence intervals
containing 1 or 0, for ratios or absolute measures respectively.
