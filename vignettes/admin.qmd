### On GitHub or own computer

Need to set a `SURVEY_ID` variable for the Google Forms Sheet ID (the

needs to be set on GitHub as well as on your own computer if you are
going to download the survey data.

1.  On GitHub, add a secret in Settings called `SURVEY_ID` with the
    Google Sheet ID.
2.  On your computer, you can either add a new variable in the form of
    `SURVEY_ID=""` in a `.Renviron` file or always get asked for it
    whenever you run the functions that require the variable (which use
    the `ukbAid:::get_survey_id()` function).
